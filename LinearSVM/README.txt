To run the code:
- we used Matlab as interface to 'liblinear', the library itself is c++ , the library should be installed first (readme file inside matalab folder) .
- the main file in ' liblinear\matlab\SVMCODE.m'
- the folder must contain folder called 'human_feature' that contains all data with names 1data_new.txt , 1data_label.txt , 2data_new.txt , 2data_label.txt and so on until 20data_new.txt , 20data_label.txt. 
- the predicted_labels and accuracy are generated after running the code.
